# About

A simple Docker Compose alternative to XAMPP in Docker.

I created this because I hate XAMPP errors.

This is ONLY for local development (Obviously), this setup is compeletely insecure. You can put it on production, if you want to get instant fired

# Running

Before using it, make sure you have the following:

- Docker Compose

After checking that you have Docker Compose, you're good to go.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
